# 📘 My C# Learning Journey

*A documented timeline of my 21-Day Challenge.*

## 🌟 Introduction
This repository tracks my journey from zero to C# proficiency. 
**Goal**: Build real applications and understand the core of .NET development.
**Current Status**: Week 2 (Intermediate)

---

## 📅 The Timeline

### Week 1: The Foundation (Dec 17)
**Focus**: Syntax, Logic, and Control Flow.
- **Day 1-4**: Mastered variables, types, and basic operators.
- **Day 5-6**: Learned Loops (`while`, `for`) and Arrays.
- **Day 7 (Project)**: Built a fully functional **Calculator App**.
    - *Key Skill*: Handling user input and converting types (`string` -> `int`).

### Week 2: Leveling Up (Dec 18 - Present)
**Focus**: Methods, Collections, and overcoming "The Wall".
- **Day 8**: Wrote my first custom Methods to organize code.
- **Day 9**: Switched from fixed Arrays to dynamic **Lists** (Game changer!).
- **Day 10**: Mastered **Parameters** and **Return Values**.
    - *Realization*: Methods act like mini-machines that take input and give output.

### ⚠️ The "Loop Bootcamp" Incident (Dec 22)
I hit a major motivational and technical wall with loops.
- **The Struggle**: Syntax errors kept breaking my code. I felt stuck.
- **The Fix**: I paused the main track and built a custom **Loop Bootcamp**.
- **The Lesson**: I learned that a stray semicolon `for(...);` destroys a loop.
- **The Pivot**: Instead of quitting, I documented the failure and decided to switch focus to **Object Oriented Programming** (Classes) to regain momentum.

## 🏆 Projects Completed
| Project | Description | Key Tech |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **EmissionCalc** | Simple logic checker | `if/else` |
| **Calculator** | Interactive math tool | `while` loops, `switch` |
| **Loop Bootcamp** | Practice sandbox | `for`, `while`, Debugging |

## 🧠 Resources Created
I have added these resources to help myself (and others) learn:
- `COMMON_MISTAKES.md`: A log of my syntax errors.
- `STUDY_TIPS.md`: Strategies for keeping motivation.
- `REFLECTIONS.md`: Honest personal logs about the learning process.

## 🔮 What's Next?
- **Day 11**: Classes & Objects (The Blueprint Concept)
- **Day 14**: Building a To-Do List App (Console based)
