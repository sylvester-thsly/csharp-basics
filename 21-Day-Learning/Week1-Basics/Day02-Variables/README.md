# Day 2: Variables (Data Containers) 📦

## 📚 Topics (Book: Tag 3)
-   What is a Variable?
-   Data Types (`int`, `double`, `string`, `bool`)
-   Naming Conventions (camelCase)

## 📝 Assignment
1.  Read **Tag 3** in your book.
2.  Open `Variables.cs`.
3.  Create variables to store:
    -   Your age
    -   Your height
    -   Your name
4.  Print them out in a sentence.

## 💡 Key Concept
**Strong Typing**: In C#, you must tell the computer what type of data is in the box. You can't put text in an `int` box!
