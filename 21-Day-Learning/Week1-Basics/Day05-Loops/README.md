# Day 5: Loops (Repetition) 🔁

## 📚 Topics (Book: Tag 6)
-   `while` loop (The ancestor)
-   `for` loop (The counter)
-   `do-while` loop (Run at least once)

## 📝 Assignment
1.  Read **Tag 6**.
2.  Open `Loops.cs`.
3.  Write a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 0 (Blastoff!).
4.  Write a `for` loop that prints even numbers from 0 to 20.

## 💡 Key Concept
**Infinite Loops**: Be careful! If your condition never becomes `false` (e.g., `while(true)`), your program will run forever until you force-quit (Ctrl+C).
