# 🚀 Career Strategy: Logistics AI Specialist
*Roadmap to turning the Cargonerds Hackathon win into a career.*

## 🎯 The Goal
Move from "Learning C#" to **"Building Predictive Logistics Tech"**.
Stop building generic apps. Start building Industry Solutions.

## 🛑 What NOT To Do
1.  **Don't stay in "Tutorial Hell"**: If you aren't building, you aren't learning.
2.  **Don't build "Toy Apps" forever**: A To-Do list is fine for Day 14, but useless for a portfolio.
3.  **Don't ignore the Business**: Code is just a tool. Understand *Logistics* (Supply Chain, Customs, CO2).
4.  **Stop doubting**: You won a Hackathon. You belong here.
