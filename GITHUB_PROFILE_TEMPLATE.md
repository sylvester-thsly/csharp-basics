### Hey there! I'm Sylvester 👋

I'm a developer from **Hamburg** who recently fell in love with C#. I went from writing my first "Hello World" to building an AI battle game in just a few weeks. Yeah, I'm kind of obsessed.

### 🎯 What I'm Up To

Right now, I'm laser-focused on mastering C# fundamentals. No shortcuts, no jumping ahead - just building a rock-solid foundation. Here's what I've been working on:

**Recent Builds:**
- 🎮 **AI Battle Game** - You vs Computer, 3 lives each. The computer's dumb right now (just random guesses), but hey, it works!
- ☕ **Coffee Shop App** - Built a whole ordering system with a running total. Learned about while loops the hard way.
- 🧮 **Calculator** - My first real project. Simple, but it taught me everything about if/else statements.

All of these are in my [csharp-basics](https://github.com/sylvester-thsly/csharp-basics) repo if you want to see the progression.

### 💭 My Learning Philosophy

I believe in **building to learn**, not learning to build. Every project teaches me something new:
- Calculator → Variables & Conditionals
- Coffee Shop → Loops & State Management  
- AI Game → Random, Lives System, Turn Logic

Next up? Probably a quiz game or maybe a to-do list. Still deciding.

I'm keeping it simple for now. Master the basics before adding more tools to the belt.
