## December 2025

- **Dec 18**: Completed Week 2 Day 8 (Methods) & Day 9 (Lists). Total: 9/21 days done! 🚀
  - Added study resources: Common Mistakes guide, Study Tips, Practice Examples
- **Dec 22**: 🏋️ Extra Practice: Loop Bootcamp.
  - Struggled with `while` and `for` loop syntax initially (forgot braces, used semicolons wrong).
  - Created `LoopPractice.cs` and fixed the bugs.
  - Successfully ran the "Annoying Kid" loop and "Countdown" loop.
  - **Lesson Learned**: `for (...);` kills the loop! Never do that again. 😅
  - *Note*: Today was really hard. Felt unmotivated but pushed through 2nd day of struggle.
  - *Strategy*: Created 10-step plan to document this journey and pivot to Methods/Classes tomorrow. 🔄
- **Dec 17**: Setup 21-Day Learning Roadmap & Week 1. Fixed Git configuration. ✅
