# Study Tips for Learning C#

## Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Read the day's README (10 mins)
2. **Practice**: Code the exercises (30-40 mins)
3. **Review**: Run and test your code (10 mins)
4. **Commit**: Push to GitHub (2 mins)

## When You Get Stuck
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check for missing semicolons
3. Verify variable names match
4. Look at the example code
5. Ask for help if still stuck

## Best Practices
- Write code every day (even 15 minutes counts!)
- Test your code frequently
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Commit small, working changes

## Keeping Motivation
- It's okay to have bad days.
- Consistency > Intensity.
- If you're stuck, just do 5 minutes.
- Document your struggles - they are part of the story!
