# Study Tips for Learning C#

## Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Read the day's README (10 mins)
2. **Practice**: Code the exercises (30-40 mins)
3. **Review**: Run and test your code (10 mins)
4. **Commit**: Push to GitHub (2 mins)

## When You Get Stuck
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check for missing semicolons
3. Verify variable names match
4. Look at the example code
5. Ask for help if still stuck

## Best Practices
- Write code every day (even 15 minutes counts!)
- Test your code frequently
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Commit small, working changes

## Keeping Motivation
- It's okay to have bad days.
- Consistency > Intensity.
- If you're stuck, just do 5 minutes.
- Document your struggles - they are part of the story!

## 🛑 End of Session Protocol (The "Streak Saver")
1. **Reflect**: What did I learn? What was hard?
2. **Log**: Update `DAILY_JOURNAL.md`.
3.  **Document**: Update `LEARNING_JOURNEY.md` with new skills.
4. **Push**: `git push` to save everything.

## 💼 Professional Workflow (Using Issues & PRs)
To get 100% on all GitHub stats (Issues, Pull Requests, Code Review), we use this cycle:
1. **Issue**: Create an issue for the task (`gh issue create`).
2. **Branch**: Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. **Work**: Code and Commit (`git commit`).
4. **Pull Request**: Upload code (`gh pr create`).
5. **Merge**: Approve and merge (`gh pr merge`).


## Progress Tracking
- Update `DAILY_JOURNAL.md` every day
- Check off days in `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
- Celebrate small wins! 🎉
