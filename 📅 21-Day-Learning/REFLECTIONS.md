# Reflections on Learning

## December 22 2024
Today I hit a wall with loops. The syntax felt confusing and I kept making small mistakes that broke the code.
It felt like I wasn't making progress, but my mentor reminded me that **struggling IS learning**.

## The Pivot
I decided that instead of fighting with loops for another hour, I would:
1. Document the failure (so I remember it).
2. Move on to **Methods** and **Classes**.
3. Come back to loops when my brain is fresh.

This strategy helps keep the momentum going.
**Streak status: ALIVE.** 🟩
