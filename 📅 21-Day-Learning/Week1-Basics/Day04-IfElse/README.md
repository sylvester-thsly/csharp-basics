# Day 4: Decision Making (Logic) 🔀

## 📚 Topics (Book: Tag 4)
-   `if` and `else` statements
-   Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)
-   Logical Operators (`&&` AND, `||` OR)

## 📝 Assignment
1.  Read **Tag 4** (second half).
2.  Open `Logic.cs`.
3.  Write a program that checks if a user is old enough to vote (age >= 18).
4.  Add a password check (if password == "secret").

## 💡 Key Concept
**Flow Control**: Normally code runs top-to-bottom. Logic statements let your code "branch" like a tree, executing different paths based on data.
