# Day 6: Arrays (Data Lists) 📚

## 📚 Topics (Book: Tag 5 Intro)
-   Declaring Arrays
-   Accessing items by Index `[0]`
-   Looping through Arrays

## 📝 Assignment
1.  Open `Arrays.cs`.
2.  Create an array of 5 favorite movies.
3.  Change the second movie (Index 1) to something else.
4.  Print all movies using a loop.

## 💡 Key Concept
**Zero-Based Indexing**: Computers start counting at 0. The first item is `[0]`, the second is `[1]`, etc.
