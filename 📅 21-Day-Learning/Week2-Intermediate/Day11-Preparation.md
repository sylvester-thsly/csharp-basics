# Day 11 Preparation: Classes & Objects

## Why are we moving here?
After struggling with loops, it's good to switch gears. Classes are a different way of thinking.

## What is a Class?
Think of a **Class** like a **Blueprint** (Plan).
Think of an **Object** like the **House** built from that plan.

## Goal for Tomorrow
- Forget about loop syntax for a day.
- Focus on designing "Things" (Pulse, Player, Car).
- Rebuild confidence with a new concept.
