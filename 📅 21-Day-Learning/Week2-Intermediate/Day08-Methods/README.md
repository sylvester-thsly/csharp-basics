# Day 8: Methods (Functions)

## 📖 What You'll Learn
Methods are **reusable blocks of code** that perform a specific task.

Think of them as **mini-programs** inside your main program!

## 🎯 Why Methods?
- **Avoid repetition**: Write code once, use it many times
- **Organize code**: Break big problems into smaller pieces
- **Easier to test**: Test each method separately

## 📚 Book Reference
**Tag 7** in "C# in 21 Tagen"

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### Basic Method Structure
```csharp
void SayHello()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
}
```

- `void` = Returns nothing
- `SayHello` = Method name
- `()` = Parameters (empty for now)
- `{ }` = Method body (the code)

### Calling a Method
```csharp
SayHello();  // This runs the method
```

## ✅ Your Task
Open `Methods.cs` and complete the TODOs to create your first methods!
