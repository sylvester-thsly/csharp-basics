## 📆 December 13, 2024 (Day 1)

### ⏰ Time Invested
- **Total:** 6 hours
- **Morning:** 3 hours (Setup + Building)
- **Afternoon:** 2 hours (Features + Git)
- **Evening:** 1 hour (Revision)

### 📚 Topics Learned
- [x] Variables & Data Types (`int`, `double`, `string`, `bool`)
- [x] Properties (`{ get; set; }`)
- [x] Classes (Blueprints for objects)
- [x] Methods (Functions that do work)
- [x] API Endpoints (POST, GET)
- [x] Database Basics (SQLite, Migrations)
- [x] Git Workflow (add, commit, push)

### 🛠️ What I Built
1. **ShipmentRecord Class** - Database model with 6 properties
2. **EmissionCalculator** - Business logic for CO2 calculations
3. **API Endpoints** - `/api/emissions/calculate` and `/api/emissions/history`
4. **Database Migration** - Added `IsPriority` field
5. **GitHub Repository** - Pushed all code with proper commits

### 💡 Key Insights
- "Properties are just labeled boxes with read/write permissions"
- "Classes are blueprints, objects are the actual things you build"
- "Migrations are like telling the database 'hey, I changed the structure'"
- "Git is scary at first but makes sense after doing it"

### 🎯 Challenges Faced
1. **Git Merge Conflicts** - Solved by understanding rebase
2. **Database Locked Errors** - Solved by stopping the app first
3. **Understanding `{ get; set; }`** - Solved by thinking of it as permissions

### 📊 Self-Assessment
- **Quiz Score:** 15/20 (75%)
- **Confidence Level:** 7/10
- **Concepts Mastered:** Variables, Classes, Properties
- **Needs Review:** Return types, Database operations, Migrations

### 🏆 Wins
- ✅ Built a working API from scratch
- ✅ Successfully used Git and GitHub
- ✅ Understood 75% of what I built
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Completed revision quiz

### 📝 Tomorrow's Goals
1. Re-do the 5 questions I got wrong
2. Learn `if` statements and conditionals
3. Complete the Priority feature (add visual indicator)
4. Practice writing methods from memory

### 🔗 Commits Today
