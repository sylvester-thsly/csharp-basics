# 📜 Certification Roadmap for Logistics AI
*Turn your skills into proof. These are the logos you want on your CV in 2025.*

## 1. The Foundation (C# & .NET)
*   **Certification**: **Microsoft Certified: Fundamentals**
*   **Why**: Prove you know the language.
*   **Cost**: Free (if you use Microsoft Learn) or low cost exams.
*   **Your Strategy**: Finish the "21 Day Challenge" first, then take a practice test.

## 2. Cloud Logistics (The Backend)
*   **Certification**: **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)**
*   **Difficulty**: Beginner/Intermediate.
*   **Why**: Every modern logistics company (Maersk, FedEx) runs on the Cloud.
*   **Goal**: Take this after you build your first API project (Day 21).

## 3. The Professional Workflow
*   **Certification**: **GitHub Foundations**
*   **Why**: Proves you know Git, Pull Requests, and Issues (what we are practicing now!).
*   **Status**: You are basically studying for this *right now* with your "Pull Shark" workflow.

## 4. Artificial Intelligence
*   **Certification**: **Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)**
*   **Why**: Prove you understand AI Agents, Machine Learning, and Chatbots.
*   **Relevance**: Perfectly matches your "Cargonerds" profile.

## 🏆 How to "Certify" Your Projects
You don't get a paper certificate for specific coding days.
**Your GitHub IS the certificate.**

*   **Day 1-21**: The "Green Squares" on your profile are proof of consistency.
*   **Projects**: The "To-Do List" and "Logistics Tracker" are proof of skill.
*   **Strategy**: When you finish a big project, pin it to your GitHub profile. That is better than a PDF certificate.
